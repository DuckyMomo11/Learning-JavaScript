### ReadMe
I have a problem committing to things, so now I'm using GitHub so I have no choice but to commit

All jokes aside, I have really enjoyed learning how to use git and currently also enjoying learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

> This repo will contain all of my JavaScript files while I feel like I'm still in my "learning" phase. I will create new repos once I feel comfortable starting bigger projects of my own
